# üöÄ Lambda Execution Unit - Complete Installation Guide
### From Zero to Smart Home Hero: A Beginner's Journey

*This guide assumes you've never used AWS or Alexa development before. We'll walk through everything step by step, explaining not just what to do, but why we're doing it.*

---

## üéØ **Understanding What We're Building**

Before we jump into installation, let's understand what the Lambda Execution Unit actually is and why it's so powerful.

Think of your current smart home setup like having a house with smart devices, but no central brain to coordinate them intelligently. Your Home Assistant is like a brilliant house manager, but it's stuck inside your house and can't talk to the outside world easily.

The Lambda Execution Unit is like hiring a professional translator who lives in the cloud and speaks both "Home Assistant language" and "Alexa language" fluently. This translator costs you nothing to employ (thanks to AWS free tier), works 24/7, and makes your entire smart home dramatically smarter and more responsive.

**Why AWS Lambda?** Think of Lambda like renting a super-computer by the millisecond. You only pay for the exact moments your smart home needs processing power. For typical home use, this means your monthly cost is $0.00 because AWS gives you so much free computing time each month.

**Why This Matters to You:** Once set up, you'll be able to say "Alexa, good night" and watch as your entire house responds intelligently - lights dimming, doors locking, temperature adjusting, security system arming - all coordinated through your existing Home Assistant setup, but now with the power of cloud computing.

## üé≠ **Choosing Your Installation Method**

We offer two paths to get your Lambda Execution Unit running. Think of these like choosing between assembling furniture with detailed instructions (Normal Method) versus having a smart robot assemble it for you (CDK Method).

### üìã **Normal Method (Recommended for Beginners)**
**Best for:** First-time AWS users, people who want to understand each step, those who prefer clicking through web interfaces.

**What it's like:** You'll use AWS's web interface to create and configure everything manually. This takes longer but helps you understand exactly what's happening at each step. It's like learning to cook by following a detailed recipe - you'll understand every ingredient and technique.

**Time Investment:** 45-60 minutes for first-time setup
**Learning Value:** High - you'll understand AWS Lambda concepts deeply
**Future Maintenance:** Easy to modify through web interface

### ü§ñ **CDK Method (For the Adventurous)**
**Best for:** People comfortable with command-line tools, those who want repeatable deployments, developers who plan to modify the system extensively.

**What it's like:** You'll install a tool on your computer that automatically creates everything in AWS for you. It's like having a smart assistant who reads your requirements and sets up everything perfectly. Faster once you understand it, but requires more initial learning.

**Time Investment:** 30-40 minutes once CDK is understood
**Learning Value:** Medium - more automated, less hands-on AWS learning
**Future Maintenance:** Requires command-line comfort but very powerful

**Our Recommendation:** Start with the Normal Method for your first deployment. You can always switch to CDK later once you understand how everything works.

## üèóÔ∏è **Pre-Installation Foundation**

### Step 1: Creating Your AWS Account (The Foundation)

AWS (Amazon Web Services) is like renting space in the world's most sophisticated computer warehouse. We need to get you a key to this warehouse.

**Important:** AWS requires a credit card for verification, but won't charge you anything for what we're building (it all fits within their generous free tier).

1. **Go to AWS Sign-Up:**
   - Visit: https://aws.amazon.com
   - Click "Create an AWS Account" (bright orange button)

2. **Account Information:**
   - **Email:** Use an email you check regularly (AWS will send important notifications here)
   - **Account Name:** Choose something memorable like "MySmartHome" or your name
   - **Password:** Make it strong - this protects access to your cloud infrastructure

3. **Contact Information:**
   - Choose "Personal" account type (unless you're a business)
   - Fill in your real information (required for verification)

4. **Payment Information:**
   - **Why they need this:** AWS uses your card for identity verification and in case you accidentally go over free limits (very unlikely with our setup)
   - **What you'll pay:** $0.00 for typical smart home usage (we've designed everything to fit in free tier)
   - Add your credit/debit card information

5. **Identity Verification:**
   - AWS will call or text you with a verification code
   - **Phone Call Option:** Answer and enter the code you see on screen using your phone's keypad
   - **Text Option:** Enter the code they send you

6. **Support Plan Selection:**
   - Choose "Basic Support - Free" (perfect for our needs)

7. **Account Activation:**
   - Wait 5-10 minutes for full activation
   - You'll receive email confirmation when ready

**Troubleshooting Common Issues:**
- **Card Declined:** Try a different card or contact your bank (international cards sometimes need approval for AWS)
- **Phone Verification Failed:** Make sure you're entering the country code correctly
- **Email Not Received:** Check spam folder, wait 10 minutes, then try account recovery

### Step 2: Setting Up Your Alexa Developer Account

Think of this as getting a license to create custom Alexa skills. It's free and connects to your existing Amazon account.

1. **Access Alexa Developer Console:**
   - Visit: https://developer.amazon.com/alexa
   - Click "Get Started" under Alexa Skills Kit

2. **Sign In Process:**
   - Use the same Amazon account you use for your Alexa devices
   - **Why this matters:** This ensures your custom skill can talk to your devices

3. **Developer Agreement:**
   - Read and accept the Alexa Developer Agreement
   - This gives you permission to create custom Alexa skills

4. **Account Verification:**
   - If prompted, verify your account with phone or email
   - This is Amazon's way of ensuring quality skill developers

**Success Check:** You should now see the Alexa Developer Console with options to "Create Skill"

### Step 3: Understanding the Configuration System

Before we install anything, let's understand the brain of your Lambda Execution Unit - the configuration system. This is like the settings panel for your entire smart home cloud integration.

**The Four-Tier System Explained:**

Think of these tiers like performance modes on a car - Eco, Normal, Sport, and Track. Each mode balances different priorities.

**üü¢ Minimum Tier (Eco Mode):**
- **Memory Usage:** 8MB (out of 128MB available)
- **Best For:** Testing, learning, or if you're approaching AWS limits
- **Features:** Basic Alexa integration, essential Home Assistant control
- **Analogy:** Like using your smartphone in power-saving mode - everything works, but with reduced features to conserve resources

**üîµ Standard Tier (Normal Mode):**
- **Memory Usage:** 45MB (comfortable middle ground)
- **Best For:** Most home users, production daily use
- **Features:** Full Alexa integration, complete Home Assistant control, basic error protection
- **Analogy:** Like your car in normal driving mode - excellent balance of performance and efficiency

**üü° Performance Tier (Sport Mode):**
- **Memory Usage:** 78MB (high performance)
- **Best For:** Power users, complex automations, faster response times
- **Features:** Enhanced caching, advanced error recovery, premium logging
- **Analogy:** Like sport mode in your car - faster response, more features, still efficient

**üî¥ Maximum Tier (Track Mode):**
- **Memory Usage:** 103MB (near the limit but safe)
- **Best For:** Ultimate performance, handling high traffic, all features enabled
- **Features:** Ultra-fast caching, intelligent prediction, comprehensive analytics
- **Analogy:** Like track mode - maximum performance with all safety systems active

**Which Should You Choose?**

For your first installation, we recommend **Standard Tier**. It provides excellent performance while leaving plenty of room for growth. You can always change this later through simple configuration updates.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Method 1: Normal Installation (Web Interface)**

This method uses AWS's web interface to set up everything manually. It's like following a detailed recipe - each step builds understanding of what you're creating.

### Phase A: Preparing Your Lambda Function

**Step 1: Accessing AWS Lambda**

1. **Sign into AWS Console:**
   - Go to https://aws.amazon.com
   - Click "Sign In" (top right)
   - Enter your account credentials

2. **Navigate to Lambda:**
   - In the AWS Console search bar (top), type "Lambda"
   - Click "Lambda" from the dropdown results
   - You're now in the Lambda dashboard (this is your function management center)

**Step 2: Creating Your Function**

1. **Start Function Creation:**
   - Click "Create function" (bright orange button)
   - Select "Author from scratch" (we're building custom functionality)

2. **Basic Function Information:**
   - **Function name:** `lambda-execution-unit` (or your preferred name)
   - **Runtime:** Select "Python 3.12" (latest stable version)
   - **Architecture:** Leave as "x86_64" (default, most compatible)

3. **Advanced Configuration:**
   - Click "Change default execution role"
   - Select "Create a new role with basic Lambda permissions"
   - **Role name:** `lambda-execution-unit-role` (AWS will create this automatically)

4. **Create the Function:**
   - Click "Create function"
   - Wait 30-60 seconds for AWS to set up your function
   - You'll see a success message and your function dashboard

**Understanding What Just Happened:**
You've just created a "container" in the cloud where your smart home logic will live. Think of it as renting a small, powerful computer that only runs when your smart home needs it.

### Phase B: Setting Up Essential AWS Infrastructure

**Step 1: IAM Role and Security Configuration**

Before we configure the Lambda function itself, we need to set up proper security infrastructure. Think of IAM (Identity and Access Management) as the security system for your cloud infrastructure - it determines what your Lambda function is allowed to do and what resources it can access.

1. **Access IAM Console:**
   - In AWS Console search bar, type "IAM"
   - Click "IAM" from the results
   - You're now in the Identity and Access Management dashboard

2. **Create Custom IAM Policy:**
   
   Your Lambda function needs specific permissions beyond the basic execution role. We'll create a custom policy that follows the principle of least privilege - giving only the permissions actually needed.

   - Click "Policies" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Create policy"
   - Select "JSON" tab
   - Replace the default content with this security policy:

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "logs:CreateLogGroup",
           "logs:CreateLogStream",
           "logs:PutLogEvents",
           "logs:DescribeLogGroups",
           "logs:DescribeLogStreams"
         ],
         "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:*:*:log-group:/aws/lambda/lambda-execution-unit*"
       },
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "ssm:GetParameter",
           "ssm:GetParameters",
           "ssm:GetParametersByPath"
         ],
         "Resource": "arn:aws:ssm:*:*:parameter/lambda-execution-unit/*"
       },
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "cloudwatch:PutMetricData"
         ],
         "Resource": "*",
         "Condition": {
           "StringEquals": {
             "cloudwatch:namespace": "LambdaExecutionUnit"
           }
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   - Click "Next: Tags" (you can skip adding tags)
   - Click "Next: Review"
   - **Policy name:** `LambdaExecutionUnitPolicy`
   - **Description:** `Custom policy for Lambda Execution Unit with least privilege access`
   - Click "Create policy"

**Understanding This Security Policy:**

This policy grants your Lambda function three specific sets of permissions, and nothing more:

**CloudWatch Logs Access** allows your function to write operational logs, error messages, and debug information. The resource restriction ensures it can only write to log groups specifically for your Lambda function, not to other systems' logs.

**Systems Manager Parameter Access** enables secure retrieval of sensitive configuration data like Home Assistant tokens. The resource restriction limits access to parameters under the `/lambda-execution-unit/` path only.

**CloudWatch Metrics Access** permits your function to record performance metrics and operational statistics. The condition restricts metric publishing to your specific namespace, preventing interference with other systems.

3. **Create Enhanced IAM Role:**
   
   Now we'll create a role that uses both the AWS managed basic execution policy and your custom policy.

   - Click "Roles" in the left IAM sidebar
   - Click "Create role"
   - Select "AWS service" (default)
   - Choose "Lambda" from the service list
   - Click "Next: Permissions"
   
   **Attach Policies:**
   - Search for and select `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` (AWS managed policy)
   - Search for and select `LambdaExecutionUnitPolicy` (your custom policy)
   - Click "Next: Tags" (skip tags for now)
   - Click "Next: Review"
   
   **Role Configuration:**
   - **Role name:** `LambdaExecutionUnitRole`
   - **Description:** `Enhanced execution role for Lambda Execution Unit with secure parameter access`
   - Click "Create role"

**Step 2: Systems Manager Parameter Store Setup**

Systems Manager Parameter Store provides secure, encrypted storage for sensitive configuration data. This is far superior to environment variables for storing secrets like API tokens.

1. **Access Systems Manager:**
   - In AWS Console search bar, type "Systems Manager"
   - Click "Systems Manager" from results
   - In the left sidebar, click "Parameter Store"

2. **Create Secure Parameters:**

   We'll create several parameters to store your sensitive configuration securely. Each parameter will be encrypted and accessible only to your Lambda function.

   **Home Assistant Token Parameter:**
   - Click "Create parameter"
   - **Name:** `/lambda-execution-unit/home-assistant/token`
   - **Description:** `Home Assistant Long-Lived Access Token`
   - **Tier:** Standard (free tier)
   - **Type:** SecureString (this encrypts the value)
   - **KMS Key Source:** My current account (uses default encryption)
   - **Value:** [Paste your Home Assistant long-lived access token here]
   - Click "Create parameter"

   **Home Assistant URL Parameter:**
   - Click "Create parameter"
   - **Name:** `/lambda-execution-unit/home-assistant/url`
   - **Description:** `Home Assistant instance URL`
   - **Type:** String (URL is not sensitive, but we store it centrally)
   - **Value:** `http://your-home-assistant-ip:8123`
   - Click "Create parameter"

   **SSL Verification Parameter:**
   - Click "Create parameter"
   - **Name:** `/lambda-execution-unit/home-assistant/ssl-verify`
   - **Description:** `SSL certificate verification setting`
   - **Type:** String
   - **Value:** `true` (set to `false` only for self-signed certificates)
   - Click "Create parameter"

   **Configuration Tier Parameter:**
   - Click "Create parameter"
   - **Name:** `/lambda-execution-unit/config/tier`
   - **Description:** `System configuration tier setting`
   - **Type:** String
   - **Value:** `standard`
   - Click "Create parameter"

**Understanding Parameter Store Benefits:**

**Security Enhancement:** Your sensitive tokens are now encrypted at rest using AWS KMS encryption. Even if someone gains access to your AWS console, they cannot see the actual token values without proper decryption permissions.

**Centralized Management:** All configuration is stored in one secure location, making it easy to update settings without modifying code or redeploying your Lambda function.

**Audit Trail:** Parameter Store automatically tracks who accessed which parameters and when, providing a complete audit trail for security compliance.

**Rotation Capability:** You can easily rotate tokens and API keys by updating the parameter values, and your Lambda function will automatically use the new values on the next execution.

**Step 3: CloudWatch Infrastructure Setup**

CloudWatch provides comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting for your Lambda function. Proper setup is essential for operational excellence and troubleshooting.

1. **Create Custom Log Group:**

   While Lambda automatically creates log groups, creating them manually gives us better control over retention and costs.

   - In AWS Console, search for "CloudWatch"
   - Click "CloudWatch" from results
   - In left sidebar, click "Logs" > "Log groups"
   - Click "Create log group"
   - **Log group name:** `/aws/lambda/lambda-execution-unit`
   - **Retention setting:** 7 days (balances debugging capability with cost control)
   - Click "Create"

**Understanding Log Retention Strategy:**

**Cost Management:** Log storage costs money after the free tier. Seven days provides sufficient time for troubleshooting while minimizing storage costs. For production systems, you might extend this to 30 days.

**Debugging Balance:** Seven days allows you to investigate issues that might not be immediately apparent, while preventing indefinite storage of routine operational logs.

2. **Set Up Custom Metrics Namespace:**

   Your Lambda function will publish custom metrics about its performance. We'll create a dedicated namespace to organize these metrics properly.

   - In CloudWatch console, click "Metrics" in left sidebar
   - Click "All metrics" tab
   - Your custom metrics will appear here after your first Lambda execution
   - The namespace will be `LambdaExecutionUnit` (as defined in your IAM policy)

3. **Create Monitoring Dashboard:**

   A dashboard provides at-a-glance monitoring of your system's health and performance.

   - In CloudWatch console, click "Dashboards" in left sidebar
   - Click "Create dashboard"
   - **Dashboard name:** `Lambda-Execution-Unit-Monitor`
   - Click "Create dashboard"

   **Add Essential Widgets:**

   For each widget, click "Add widget" and configure:

   **Widget 1: Lambda Invocations**
   - Widget type: Line graph
   - Metrics: AWS/Lambda > By Function Name
   - Function: lambda-execution-unit
   - Metric: Invocations
   - Statistic: Sum
   - Period: 5 minutes

   **Widget 2: Error Rate**
   - Widget type: Line graph  
   - Metrics: AWS/Lambda > By Function Name
   - Function: lambda-execution-unit
   - Metric: Errors
   - Statistic: Sum
   - Period: 5 minutes

   **Widget 3: Duration**
   - Widget type: Line graph
   - Metrics: AWS/Lambda > By Function Name
   - Function: lambda-execution-unit
   - Metric: Duration
   - Statistic: Average
   - Period: 5 minutes

   **Widget 4: Memory Utilization**
   - Widget type: Number
   - Metrics: AWS/Lambda > By Function Name
   - Function: lambda-execution-unit
   - Metric: MaxMemoryUsed
   - Statistic: Maximum
   - Period: 5 minutes

   - Click "Save dashboard"

4. **Configure Critical Alerts:**

   Alerts notify you of issues before they impact your smart home functionality.

   **High Error Rate Alert:**
   - In CloudWatch, click "Alarms" > "All alarms"
   - Click "Create alarm"
   - Click "Select metric"
   - Browse: AWS/Lambda > By Function Name > lambda-execution-unit > Errors
   - Click "Select metric"
   - **Statistic:** Sum
   - **Period:** 5 minutes
   - **Threshold:** Static > Greater than > 5
   - **Datapoints to alarm:** 1 out of 1
   - Click "Next"
   - **Alarm state trigger:** In alarm
   - **Send notification to:** Create new topic
   - **Topic name:** `lambda-execution-unit-alerts`
   - **Email:** Your email address
   - Click "Create topic" and "Next"
   - **Alarm name:** `Lambda-Execution-Unit-High-Error-Rate`
   - **Description:** `Alert when Lambda function has more than 5 errors in 5 minutes`
   - Click "Next" and "Create alarm"

   **Memory Usage Alert:**
   - Repeat the process above but select MaxMemoryUsed metric
   - **Threshold:** Static > Greater than > 120000000 (120MB in bytes)
   - **Alarm name:** `Lambda-Execution-Unit-High-Memory-Usage`
   - **Description:** `Alert when memory usage approaches 128MB limit`

**Understanding Monitoring Strategy:**

**Proactive Issue Detection:** These alerts catch problems before they impact your smart home functionality. High error rates indicate configuration issues, while high memory usage warns of potential performance problems.

**Cost Protection:** The error rate alert helps identify runaway function executions that could consume your free tier allocation unexpectedly.

**Performance Optimization:** Memory usage monitoring helps you optimize your configuration tier selection for best performance within constraints.

### Phase C: Configuring Your Function Settings

**Step 1: Memory and Timeout Configuration**

1. **Access Configuration:**
   - In your function dashboard, click the "Configuration" tab
   - Select "General configuration" from the left sidebar

2. **Update Function Configuration:**
   - Click "Edit" (top right of the General configuration section)
   - **Memory:** Set to 128 MB (maximum for free tier, perfect for our optimized code)
   - **Timeout:** Set to 30 seconds (plenty of time for smart home operations)
   - **Execution role:** Select "Use an existing role"
   - **Existing role:** Choose `LambdaExecutionUnitRole` (the role we created in Phase B)
   - **Description:** "Smart home bridge between Home Assistant and Alexa with secure parameter access"

3. **Save Changes:**
   - Click "Save"
   - These settings optimize your function for smart home responsiveness while staying in free tier

**Step 2: Environment Variables Setup**

Now we'll configure your function to use the secure parameters we stored in Systems Manager, rather than storing sensitive information directly in environment variables.

1. **Access Environment Variables:**
   - Still in "Configuration" tab
   - Click "Environment variables" from the left sidebar

2. **Add Configuration Variables:**
   - Click "Edit"
   - Click "Add environment variable" for each of these:

   **Core System Variables:**
   ```
   USE_PARAMETER_STORE = true
   PARAMETER_PREFIX = /lambda-execution-unit
   AWS_REGION = us-east-1
   DEBUG_MODE = false
   ```

   **Performance Configuration Variables:**
   ```
   CACHE_TTL = 300
   MAX_RETRIES = 3
   RESPONSE_TIMEOUT = 10
   LOG_LEVEL = INFO
   CLOUDWATCH_NAMESPACE = LambdaExecutionUnit
   ```

3. **Save Environment Variables:**
   - Click "Save"

**Understanding the Secure Configuration Approach:**

**Parameter Store Integration:** By setting `USE_PARAMETER_STORE = true`, your Lambda function will automatically retrieve sensitive configuration from the encrypted parameter store we set up, rather than using potentially insecure environment variables.

**Security Benefits:** Your Home Assistant tokens and other sensitive data are now encrypted at rest and only accessible to your specific Lambda function with proper IAM permissions. This follows AWS security best practices.

**Centralized Management:** Configuration changes can now be made by updating parameters in Systems Manager without redeploying your Lambda function code.

**Understanding Configuration Tiers:**
- `standard` = Recommended for most users (45MB memory usage)
- `minimum` = Testing or resource-constrained (8MB memory usage)
- `performance` = Enhanced features (78MB memory usage)
- `maximum` = All features enabled (103MB memory usage)

### Phase C: Installing Your Code

**Step 1: Preparing the Code Package**

You'll need to create a deployment package with all your Lambda Execution Unit code. 

1. **Download the Project Files:**
   - Get all the `.py` files from the Lambda Execution Unit project
   - Create a folder on your computer called `lambda-execution-unit`
   - Place all Python files in this folder

3. **Configure Skill Settings:**
   - Click "Create skill"
   - You'll see the skill dashboard

**Step 2: Connecting Alexa to Your Lambda**

1. **Get Your Lambda ARN:**
   - Go back to your AWS Lambda function
   - Copy the "Function ARN" (top right of the function overview)
   - It looks like: `arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789:function:lambda-execution-unit`

2. **Configure Alexa Endpoint:**
   - In Alexa Developer Console, go to "Smart Home" section
   - **Default endpoint:** Paste your Lambda ARN
   - Click "Save"

3. **Set Up Account Linking (Optional):**
   - If you want enhanced security, configure account linking
   - For basic setup, you can skip this initially

### Phase E: Home Assistant Configuration

**Step 1: Preparing Home Assistant Integration**

1. **Get Your Home Assistant Information:**
   - **Home Assistant URL:** Your HA instance URL (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8123`)
   - **Access Token:** Generate in HA: Profile > Security > Long-Lived Access Tokens

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Go back to AWS Lambda > Configuration > Environment variables
   - Add these variables:
   ```
   HOME_ASSISTANT_URL = http://your-ha-ip:8123
   HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN = your-long-lived-token
   HOME_ASSISTANT_SSL_VERIFY = true
   ```

   **Note:** Set `HOME_ASSISTANT_SSL_VERIFY = false` only if you're using self-signed certificates on your local network.

**Step 2: Testing the Integration**

1. **Create Test Event:**
   - In Lambda, go to "Test" tab
   - Click "Create new event"
   - **Event name:** "HomeAssistantTest"
   - **Template:** Use this JSON:
   ```json
   {
     "directive": {
       "header": {

## ü§ñ **Method 2: CDK Installation (Automated)**

CDK (Cloud Development Kit) is like having a smart assistant who reads your requirements and automatically builds everything in AWS. This method is faster once you understand it, but requires installing tools on your computer first.

### Phase A: Setting Up CDK Environment

**Step 1: Installing Prerequisites**

Before we can use CDK, we need to install some tools on your computer. Think of these as the basic tools needed to communicate with AWS.

**For Windows Users:**

1. **Install Node.js:**
   - Go to https://nodejs.org
   - Download the LTS version (recommended for most users)
   - Run the installer with default settings
   - **Why we need this:** CDK is built on Node.js technology

2. **Install Python:**
   - Go to https://python.org/downloads
   - Download Python 3.12 or later
   - **Important:** Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
   - **Why we need this:** Our Lambda code runs on Python

3. **Install AWS CLI:**
   - Download from: https://aws.amazon.com/cli/
   - Run installer with default settings
   - **Why we need this:** Allows your computer to talk to AWS

**For Mac Users:**

1. **Install Homebrew (if not already installed):**
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. **Install Required Tools:**
   ```bash
   brew install node python aws-cli
   ```

**For Linux Users:**

1. **Install Node.js and Python:**
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nodejs npm python3 python3-pip

   # CentOS/RHEL
   sudo yum install nodejs npm python3 python3-pip
   ```

2. **Install AWS CLI:**
   ```bash
   pip3 install awscli
   ```

**Step 2: Installing and Configuring CDK**

1. **Install AWS CDK:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g aws-cdk
   ```

2. **Verify Installation:**
   ```bash
   cdk --version
   ```
   You should see a version number like `2.100.0`

3. **Configure AWS Credentials:**
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```
   
   When prompted, enter:
   - **AWS Access Key ID:** Get from AWS Console > Security Credentials
   - **AWS Secret Access Key:** Get from AWS Console > Security Credentials  
   - **Default region:** `us-east-1` (recommended for Alexa skills)
   - **Default output format:** `json`

**Getting AWS Credentials:**
1. In AWS Console, click your name (top right) > Security Credentials
2. Scroll to "Access keys" section
3. Click "Create access key" > Choose "Command Line Interface (CLI)"
4. Download or copy the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key

**Step 3: Bootstrapping CDK**

CDK needs to set up some infrastructure in your AWS account before it can deploy resources. This is a one-time setup.

```bash
cdk bootstrap
```

This command creates the necessary resources for CDK to work in your AWS account. You'll see output showing resources being created.

### Phase B: Creating Your CDK Project

**Step 1: Project Initialization**

1. **Create Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir lambda-execution-unit-cdk
   cd lambda-execution-unit-cdk
   ```

2. **Initialize CDK Project:**
   ```bash
   cdk init app --language python
   ```

3. **Install Python Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**Step 2: Creating the CDK Stack**

Replace the contents of `lambda_execution_unit_cdk/lambda_execution_unit_cdk_stack.py` with this deployment configuration:

```python
from aws_cdk import (
    Stack,
    aws_lambda as _lambda,
    aws_iam as iam,
    Duration,
    CfnOutput
)
from constructs import Construct

class LambdaExecutionUnitCdkStack(Stack):
    def __init__(self, scope: Construct, construct_id: str, **kwargs) -> None:
        super().__init__(scope, construct_id, **kwargs)

        # Create IAM role for Lambda
        lambda_role = iam.Role(
            self, "LambdaExecutionRole",
            assumed_by=iam.ServicePrincipal("lambda.amazonaws.com"),
            managed_policies=[
                iam.ManagedPolicy.from_aws_managed_policy_name("service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole")
            ]
        )

        # Create Lambda function
        lambda_function = _lambda.Function(
            self, "LambdaExecutionUnit",
            runtime=_lambda.Runtime.PYTHON_3_12,
            handler="lambda_function.lambda_handler",
            code=_lambda.Code.from_asset("../lambda-code"),
            role=lambda_role,
            timeout=Duration.seconds(30),
            memory_size=128,
            environment={
                "CONFIGURATION_TIER": "standard",
                "HOME_ASSISTANT_ENABLED": "true",
                "ALEXA_SKILL_ENABLED": "true",
                "DEBUG_MODE": "false"
            }
        )

        # Output the Lambda ARN for Alexa configuration
        CfnOutput(
            self, "LambdaArn",
            value=lambda_function.function_arn,
            description="Lambda Function ARN for Alexa Skill configuration"
        )
```

**Step 3: Preparing Your Code**

1. **Create Code Directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir lambda-code
   ```

2. **Copy Lambda Execution Unit Files:**
   Copy all your Python files (.py files) into the `lambda-code` directory:
   ```
   lambda-code/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lambda_function.py
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ homeassistant_extension.py
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ variables.py
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ variables_utils.py
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [all other .py files]
   ```

### Phase C: Deploying with CDK

**Step 1: Validate Your Configuration**

1. **Review Configuration:**
   Edit the environment variables in your CDK stack to match your setup:
   ```python
   environment={
       "CONFIGURATION_TIER": "standard",  # Change if desired
       "HOME_ASSISTANT_ENABLED": "true",
       "ALEXA_SKILL_ENABLED": "true", 
       "HOME_ASSISTANT_URL": "http://your-ha-ip:8123",
       "HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN": "your-token-here",
       "DEBUG_MODE": "false"
   }
   ```

2. **Synthesize Stack (Preview):**
   ```bash
   cdk synth
   ```
   This shows you what CDK will create without actually creating it.

**Step 2: Deploy Your Stack**

1. **Deploy to AWS:**
   ```bash
   cdk deploy
   ```

2. **Confirm Deployment:**
   Type `y` when prompted to proceed with changes

3. **Wait for Completion:**
   CDK will show progress as it creates resources
   Deployment typically takes 2-3 minutes

4. **Save the Output:**
   CDK will display your Lambda ARN at the end
   Copy this ARN - you'll need it for Alexa configuration

### Phase D: Post-CDK Alexa Setup

Follow the same Alexa setup steps from Method 1, using the Lambda ARN that CDK provided in its output.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Advanced Configuration Guide**

### Understanding Configuration Tiers in Detail

Your Lambda Execution Unit uses an intelligent configuration system that automatically balances performance, features, and resource usage. Think of it like the performance modes in a modern car - each mode optimizes different aspects of the system.

**How to Change Configuration Tiers:**

**Method 1 (Environment Variables):**
1. In AWS Lambda Console > Configuration > Environment variables
2. Edit `CONFIGURATION_TIER` variable
3. Change value to: `minimum`, `standard`, `performance`, or `maximum`
4. Save changes

**Method 2 (CDK):**
1. Edit your CDK stack file
2. Change the `CONFIGURATION_TIER` value in environment variables
3. Run `cdk deploy` to update

**Detailed Tier Comparison:**

```
Configuration Feature Comparison

Feature                 | Minimum | Standard | Performance | Maximum
------------------------|---------|----------|-------------|--------

Metrics Tracking       | Basic   | Full     | Enhanced    | Premium
Cost Protection        | Active  | Active   | Active      | Active
```

### Home Assistant Specific Configuration

**SSL/TLS Configuration:**

If your Home Assistant uses self-signed certificates (common for local installations), you'll need to disable SSL verification:

```
Environment Variable: HOME_ASSISTANT_SSL_VERIFY = false
```

**Warning:** Only use this for local network installations with self-signed certificates. For internet-accessible Home Assistant instances, always use proper SSL certificates.

**Advanced Home Assistant Settings:**

```
HOME_ASSISTANT_TIMEOUT = 10          # Seconds to wait for HA response
HOME_ASSISTANT_RETRIES = 3           # Number of retry attempts
HOME_ASSISTANT_CACHE_TTL = 300       # How long to cache HA state (seconds)
DEVICE_DISCOVERY_INTERVAL = 3600     # How often to rediscover devices (seconds)
```

### Alexa Skill Advanced Configuration

**Custom Intent Handling:**

Your Lambda function can be extended to handle custom Alexa intents beyond basic smart home control. Add these environment variables:

```
CUSTOM_INTENTS_ENABLED = true
INTENT_CACHE_TTL = 600
ALEXA_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT = 5
```

**Multi-Language Support:**

```
ALEXA_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE = en-US
ALEXA_SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES = en-US,en-GB,de-DE
```

### Performance Optimization Settings

**Caching Configuration:**

```
CACHE_STRATEGY = intelligent        # Options: basic, standard, intelligent
CACHE_MEMORY_LIMIT = 20971520      # 20MB cache limit
CACHE_CLEANUP_INTERVAL = 1800      # Clean old cache every 30 minutes
```

**Circuit Breaker Tuning:**

```
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_ENABLED = true
FAILURE_THRESHOLD = 5              # Trip circuit after 5 failures
RECOVERY_TIMEOUT = 30              # Wait 30 seconds before retry
SUCCESS_THRESHOLD = 3              # Need 3 successes to close circuit
```
