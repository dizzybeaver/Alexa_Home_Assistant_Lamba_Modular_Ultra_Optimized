## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_REFERENCE.md CHANGES PENDING

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The Revolutionary Gateway Optimization fundamentally changes the architecture described in PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_REFERENCE.md. The current implementation uses:

**OLD ARCHITECTURE (PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_REFERENCE.md):**
- 11 separate gateway files (cache.py, logging.py, security.py, etc.)
- Each gateway file delegates to its corresponding _core.py
- External files import from individual gateways

**NEW REVOLUTIONARY ARCHITECTURE (SUGA):**
- 1 universal gateway file (gateway.py) 
- All operations route through single entry point
- Lazy loading of core modules on-demand
- External files import from gateway.py only

**ACTION REQUIRED:**
When all phases are complete, PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_REFERENCE.md must be updated to reflect the new SUGA architecture. For now, skip any references to the gateway architecture changes in PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_REFERENCE.md since we are in active implementation.
